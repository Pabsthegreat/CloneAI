# Tests (`tests/`)

This directory contains the test suite for CloneAI.

## Running Tests

We use `pytest`.

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_advanced_email_features.py
```

## Structure

Tests generally mirror the structure of the `agent/` directory, though they are currently a flat list of files.
